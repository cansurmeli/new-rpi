# New rPi

This is a bash script that I run once I set up a new Raspberry Pi.

## Why?

Every Raspberry Pi that I setup serves different purposes with various other configuration options; however, they all share some common foundations.

This bash script goes through those initial setup steps to bring up a new Raspberry Pi I've setup on par with my needs.

## What is it doing?

The script itself is pretty self-explanatory and it's well commented.

## Forking

This script doesn't go into my specific needs but covers a general basis.

However, I encourage you to fork it and make it serve your own needs.

Bash scriptign is quite powerfull and it will save you a lot of time!
